    Update the game board by placing a checker in the specified column.

    This function takes the current board status, the player's checker color,
    and the column in which they want to place the checker, then updates the board accordingly.
    If the column is full, the current board is returned unchanged.

    Args:
        board_temp (numpy.ndarray): A 2x6x7 representation of the game board.
            The first layer corresponds to one player, and the second layer to the other.
            Values are 0 (empty) or 1 (occupied).
        color (str): The color of the checker, either 'red' or 'yellow'.
            'red' corresponds to the first layer (index 0), and 'yellow' to the second layer (index 1).
        column (int): The column (0 through 6) where the checker should be placed.
            If the column is full, the board remains unchanged.

    Returns:
        numpy.ndarray: The updated board after placing the checker.
        If the column is full, the original board is returned.

    Notes:
        - The board is copied before making modifications, ensuring the original input remains unchanged.
