    "**Questions**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Should we put more error checking in our code? We risk slowing things down with more error checking. Maybe we should only have error checking for human play.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is MCTS not working? Is the backprop function not right? Maybe try reversing the numbers in backprop. Try playing MCTS against MCTS.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overview of MCTS**\n",
    "\n",
    "MCTS balances betwen exploring possible moves and exploting successful moves. It's useful for Connect 4 because there are more states than can be explored due to computational limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Components:\n",
    "- Tree traversal and node expansion\n",
    "    - Determine the possible plays for various board states\n",
    "- Rollout\n",
    "    - Random simulation of a game that is used to determine the next best move when you reach a node (board state) that you haven't yet exploited (tried playing)\n",
    "- Backpropagation\n",
    "    - Retrace your path to the root node, updating the win rate for each node\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps:\n",
    "- Start at root node (empty board or provided board)\n",
    "- Check if the current node is a leaf node (win/lose/tie state)\n",
    "   - If a node is identified as a leaf node but it's not a win/lose/tie state, the current node may not have child nodes added yet.\n",
    "       - If the node hasn't had a simulation yet, run a simulation to determine the selection value (UCBI/UCT)\n",
    "       - If the node has already had a simulation, add each available action from the current node as a new state to the tree\n",
    "    - If a node is not identified as a leaf node, select one of the child nodes of current that maximizes the selection value (child nodes that haven't yet been explored will have higher selection values)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Upper Confidence Bound for Trees (UCT)** formula used to pick move:\n",
    "$$UCT = \\frac{W_i}{N_i} + C \\sqrt{\\frac{\\ln{N_p}}{N_i}} $$\n",
    "- $W_i$: Total wins for the child node *i*.\n",
    "- $N_i$: Total simulations for the child node *i*.\n",
    "- $N_p$: Total simulations for the parent node\n",
    "- $C$: exploitation paramter, balancing exploration and exploitation\n",
    "- Exploitation (left term) and exploration (right term) are balanced\n",
    "    - MCTS will initially favor exploration over exploitation because child nodes that haven't been explored will have infinitely large UCT values (denominator $N_i = 0$)\n",
    "- Traverse the tree by selecting the child node with the highest UCT value until a leaf node is reached.\n",
    "    - If the child nodes or other nodes along the path don't have UCT values, then they will be randomly chosen until a terminal node is reached (win/loss/tie)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To learn more about MCTS, here are a few links that informed my notes:\n",
